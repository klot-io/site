# Klot I/O

Klot I/O, short for Kloud of Things I/O, is a Kubernetes cloud running on Raspberry Pi’s with the ability to download and install Apps that can utilize the I/O hardware of those Pi’s.  

Klot I/O lowers the barrier of entry to many relevant technologies (Docker, Kubernetes, REST, Python, GPIO) by allowing someone with no knowledge to easily setup said technologies in their own home. 

I've included a sample project on this site. When you're done with it, you'll have a Raspberry Pi that'll convert text to speech (in an Australian account if you so desire). [More Info](http://klot.io)

## Requirements and background

You need to be able to burn an image on a Raspber

### Kubernetes

klot.io enables <TODO: unique use case for k8s>, which you can read about in [docname](doclink).

This project assumes <TODO: what level of> familiarity with Kubernetes. If you're just getting started with Kubernetes, read [name](link).

### Raspberry Pis

Most Raspberry Pis aren't linked together in a local cloud. klot.io rectifies that, so you have all the power of orchestration to run your internet of things. To read more about unique things you can do with Pis when they're networked like this, read [docname](doclink).

This project showcases only two Pi features - their ability to play sound, and their ability to connect to your local ethernet network. If you want to learn more about what Pis can do, and dream up all kinds of interesting apps you can run your new local cloud, read [name](link).

### Microservices

<TODO: say something about microservices and link to another doc on the site about what you can do with them>

### Prerequisites

- <TODO: list all materials and networks needed>

## Install

Instructino

## Next steps

If you want configure a sample app that tells your kids to wake up, in an Australian accent, go to [Apps](Apps.md).
