    <h1>Apps! Apps! Apps!</h1>

    <p>
        Make sure you have a Master node and a Worker or two before installing Apps.
        Head back to <a href="{{=DRApp.link('install')}}">Install</a> for how.
        Else hit up the Apps page on your Master.
    </p>

    <h2>Download</h2>

    <p>
        Before an App can be installed, it has to be downloaded. 
        In the future, I'll have a bunch of Apps already downloaded.
        For now, we'll have to download manually.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In the future, I'll have a bunch of Apps period.  
        For now there's just Nandy Speech and Redis.
        Nandy Speech allows you hook up some speakers to your Pi and make it say stuff, even in various accents.
        It'll be used by the forthcoming Nandy Chore to yell at you or your kids to do stuff. 
        Redis is a general Redis server which can be used by other Apps, like Nandy Speech.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Go to the Apps page.</li>
        <li>Select GitHub.</li>
        <li>Enter 'nandy-io/speech' in owner/project field.</li>
        <li>Click the Download button.</li>
        <li>In 10-20 seconds, Nandy Speech adn Redis will appear in the Apps listing.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Labels</h2>

    <p>
        Some Apps require that you label nodes to install service on speciallly enabled nodes os just consistently. 
        The App's page allows you to set these labels easily with checkboxes.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Click the Redis App.</li>
        <li>Click a checkbox under labels to install it on a specfic Node (required).</li>
        <li>It will be automatically saved.</li>
        <li>You can uncheck a checkbox to remvoe a label.</li>
        <li>Go back to Apps.</li>
        <li>Click the Nandy App.</li>
        <li>Click a checkbox under labels to tell it which Nodes have speakers attached (you can use headphones for now).</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        For you Kubernetes savy folks, yes this is labeling Nodes through traditional Kubernetes. 
        It'll prefix the actual labels with the app name. 
        So `storage` is really `redis.klot.io/storage` and 'speakers' is really `speech.nandy.io/speakers`. 
    </p>

    <h2>Install</h2>

    <p>
        When Ready, click Install and head over to the Pods page to watch the Pods come up.
        Once they're all up, head back to Apps, and click Open in the Nandy Speech App.
        Type something (preferably inappropriate) and listen to your own shenanigans.
    </p>

    <h2>Great Success!</h2>

    <p>
        Congrats! You now have Redis running in your home cluster.
    </p>

    <p>
        Yep, that's a URL on your local network based on the App and Service name. 
        For you Kubernetes savy folks, yes the site on each node act as a distributed Ingress controller using LoadBalancer Service definitions.
        For anyone wondering how the hell the DNS is working, we're using those same Service to register CNAMES through avahi / mDNS.  Neat huh?
        See <a href="{{=DRApp.link('architecture')}}">Architecture</a> to learn more.
    </p>

    <p>
        Currently, you can only access this Redis instance from Kubernetes directly.
        Check out <a href="{{=DRApp.link('development')}}">Development</a> to setup access to your cluster through kubectl.
