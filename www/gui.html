    <h1>GUI</h1>

    <p>
        For those not in the know, GUI stands for Graphical User Interface.
        It's the little ol' website you log into do the things.
    </p>

    <hr/>
    
    <h2>Login</h2>

    <p>
        If you haven't logged in, this is the only page that'll work. 
        The default passwords if nothing's been configured is 'kloudofthings' because I'm a man of mystery if anything. 
        Just type in that or the password you changed everything to and hit return.
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <h2>Config</h2>

    <p>
        If you've logged in, but haven't set anything up, you'll end up at Config.
        This is where you can configure (obvs) this Node. 
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <h2>Status</h2>

    <p>
        If you've congfigured, the Node has an idea of what's it's supposed to be and will send you here. 
        This is the Status of the Node and contains a list of what each Status means.
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <h2>Logs</h2>

    <p>
        Here you can check in on this and other components by viewing ther logs.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Daemon</strong> - You can look at it's logs here, and see things like tracebacks like with the API.</li>
            <li><strong>API</strong> - You can look at the API's logs here, and see things like tracebacks where things go super wrong.</li>
            <li><strong>GUI</strong> - The logs for this interface.  Nothing much interesting here. You can  mainly check the return code from the API.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <h2>Node</h2>

    <p>
        These are all the Nodes of the your cluster, what their current statuses are, and how to add or remove Nodes from the cluster. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Btw, this page is a little slow because querying Kubernetes is slow.
        I can improve by either caching node info or having the GUI be more async - just haven't gotten around to either.
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <h2>Pods</h2>

    <p>
        Here you can see all the Pods in the Kuberenetes cluster and there status.
        It's really only good for basic "Hey is this thing running yet?" but I plan to add Logs for the Pods as well. 
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <h2>Apps</h2>

    <p>
        This is where you can Install Apps or just Download Apps to check whats a gonna happenin'.
        The Apps listing shows Action and Status.
        Action is what you intend to happen.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Download</strong> - Download the App and any Apps it requires. 
                <ul>
                    <li>The App file and all the resources it specifies (file contents are stored on the App resouce).</li>
                    <li>Any Apps required by this App and all of their manifests (and requirements.</li>
                    <li>This only adds App resources to Kuberentes. It doesn't apply any manifests.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Install</strong> - Download (if not already) and Install the App and any Apps it requires. 
                <ul>
                    <li>Install required Apps first (and their dependencies first).</li>
                    <li>Apply this Apps resources (in proper order, Namespaces first, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Project required App's configuratoin into this Apps.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Open</strong> - Open this App's URL (to access the App)
                <ul>
                    <li>This really isn't an Action in Kubernetes, just some UX sugar because we like our Users.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Uninstall</strong> - Remove this App's Resources from Kubernetes
                <ul>
                    <li>Delete this Apps manifests (in opposite order, Namespaces last etc.)</li>
                    <li>Remove required App's configuratoin frpm this App.</li>
                    <li>Required Apps are not automatically Uninstalled and must be done so manually.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Delete</strong> - Remove the App from Kubernetes entirely
                <ul>
                    <li>Can only be done if not Installed.</li>
                    <li>Will no longer appear in the App listing.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        Status is what's happened so far. 
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Discovered</strong> - The App resource is in Kubernetes, but not its manifests or dependencies.</li>
            <li><strong>Downloaded</strong> - The App resource, manifests or dependencies are in Kubernetes.</li>
            <li><strong>Installed</strong> - The App resource, manifests or dependencies are in Kubernetes.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        If you click on a row, you get a deeper view into the App. 
        <ul>
            <li><strong>name</strong> - The name of the app, usually looks like a domain.</li>
            <li><strong>description</strong> - Friendly, human happy explanation of the App.</li>
            <li><strong>url</strong> - Link to access the App once installed.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>labels</strong> - Labels for the App, how to tag specific Nodes for specific uses.
                <ul>
                    <li>I like to install Redis and on DB's on specific Node because either I have an external drive attached or I want the data kept in one place.</li>
                    <li>Certain Apps will only deploy functionality on Nodes that have hardware attached, like speakers, a button, or even a camera.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>action</strong> - What you intended the App to do.</li>
            <li><strong>status</strong> - Where the App is currently at.</li>
