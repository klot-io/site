    <h1>How the &*%$#! Does This Thing Work?</h1>

    <h2>Proununciation</h2>

    <p>
        First things first: how to say "klot.io".
        It's pronounced "clout-i-o" not "clot-ee-eye-ee-eye-oh".
        A common misconception but imagine the sheer embarassment and horror from
        misprouncing the latest and greatest open source project that no one's ever heard of.
        That's almost as bad as mispelling the first subheading of an instructional page.
    </p>

    <p>
        Perish the thought.
    </p>

    <h2>Caveat Emptor</h2>

    <p>
        That's Latin for "cover your butt." This is brand new, not secure, and by not means production ready.
        I've worked in Magnetics, Electrical, Software, Site Reliability, and Infrastructure Engineering.
        There are many methods used here I would NEVER use in a real environment at a real company.
        (Hey, let's log in but not bother with TLS because REASONS)
        Eventually, we can lock things down with certs and what not, but for now, consider this experimental.

    <h2>Cut My Life Into Pieces - This is my Last Resort</h2>

    <p>
        So what's going on here?
        <ul>
            <li>We have Raspberry Pi's.</li>
            <li>We have Kubernetes running on our Raspberry Pi's.</li>
            <li>We have Services managing Kubernetes.</li>
            <li>We have Apps being installed through those Services.</li>
        </ul>
        Let's break it down how everything works together.
    </p>

    <h2>Raspberry Pi's</h2>

    <p>
        The SD card is the Raspberry Pi's hard drive.
        When we install an image onto the SD card, we install an operating system, like installing Window ME from floppy disks.
        The operating system we're using is just Raspbian with some stuff added.
        Raspbian is a variant of Debian, which is a distribution of Linux.
    </p>

    <p>
        With Linux, you can use it like desktop, with your mouse and windows, etc. like a happy little quaint home.
        Or you can use it like a server, with just a login prompt, like a commerical building. (yes, it's more complicated than that, but this is just an overview)
    </p>

    <p>
        In our case, we're using our Raspberry Pi's like servers, like a block of big ol' non descript buildings.
        Imagine the giant servers that run the Internet, making clouds, serving websites, and what have you.
        Our Raspberry Pi's are just miniature versions of those.
    </p>

    <h2>Kubernetes</h2>

    <p>
        Kubernetes is a Container Cloud Technology.
        As they say, there is no Cloud - it's just someone else's computer (yours in this case).
        What they mean is that a Cloud is just a bunch of computers, which "rent out" space.
    </p>

    <p>
        Think of it like apartment complex vs. a house.
    </p>

    <p>
        With a (single family) house there's one building, one residence.
        The occupants are responsible for all aspects, like power, water, sewer (well, in my house where I have a well and septic system, and have to talk to the power company from time to time).
        Moving in or out is a big deal because you have to set all sorts of stuff up, get inspections, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
        With an apartment complex, there's multiple buildings, each with multiple residences.
        The occupants aren't responsible for all aspects, like power, water, sewer (apparently, you can just call some guy and he fixes everything? So weird.).
        With less responsibilities to transfer, it becomes easier to move in and move out.
    </p>

    <p>
        Originally, Clouds were done with Virtual Machines, not Containers.
    </p>

    <p>
        A Virtual Machine is a simulated computer in software (tenant) being run on a physical computer's hardware (host).
        This is done through interacting directly with the Physical Processor of the host machine.
        Think of a Virtual Machine occupying an unfurnished apartment.
        There's hook ups for water, and power, but you have to bring in all your own furniture and the amount of space is for memory and processing is fixed.
    </p>

    <p>
        A Container is also a simulated computer in software (tenant) being run on a physical computer's hardware (host).
        This is done through interacting directly with the Operating System the host machine, not the hardware, using something called Docker.
        Think of a Container occupying a furnished apartment.
        There's already beds, a washing machine, shared storage spaces, even a pool (of resources) that can be shared, like  memory and processing.
        You can even set limits on how much each tenant can use.
    </p>

    <p>
        We're using Kubernetes, a Container Cloud, because it's even easier to move in and out of a furnished apartment vs. an unfurnished one.
    </p>

    <h2>Services</h2>

    <p>
        While using Kubernetes is easy, easier than using physical or even virtual machines anyway, setting up Kubernetes is not.
        That's where Services come in.
        Think of them like Contractors turning your Pi's into an apartment complex, all with different jobs:
        <ul>
            <li>GUI - The adorable little web site you've been using.</li>
            <li>API - The brains of the adorablness, what the GUI's talking to.</li>
            <li>Daemon - The brawns of the operation, what really does most of the work.</li>
            <li>DNS - The mini DNS server for when mDNS isn't sufficient.</li>
            <li>/boot - A back door of control directly from your SD card.</li>
        </ul>
        Each one of these is running / working on every Raspberry Pi.
    </p>

    <p>
        Kubernetes is Cluster technology, meaning it's a process running on serveral servers, all working together.
        This doesn't happen automatically (yet?).
        We have to install Docker and Kubernetes and then start Kubernetes on each Pi, telling each what they're supposed to do.
        Lucky for you, the Klot I/O image you burned already has Kubernetes and Docker installed.
        Also lucky for you, <a href="https://github.com/klot-io/pi-setup/blob/master/Install.md">Install</a> walks you through the process of telling the Contractors how you want your cluster configured.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Master Node is like the office of the apartment complex.
        Worker Nodes are like the pure rental units of the apartment complex.
        The Master Node responsible for moving tenants in and out of the cloud, signing leases, figuring out building to move into, giving them keys, etc.
        The Master Node is also responsibile for making sure the apartment buildings are up to snuff, taking a building out of "rentability" if it's not working.
        Usually tenants don't live here because the Master Node is usually pretty busy, but they can (the Redis App allows for it).
    </p>

    <p>
        Going through the <a href="https://github.com/klot-io/pi-setup/blob/master/Install.md">Install</a> easy process, this how the Services interact:
        <ol>
            <li>The User hits the GUI.</li>
            <li>The GUI hits the API.</li>
            <li>The API reads the current configuration and sends it back to the GUI.</li>
            <li>The GUI present the information to the User in a friendly, easy to read format.</li>
            <li>The User changes the information in the GUI.</li>
            <li>The GUI sends the new Configuration to the API.</li>
            <li>The API saves the Configuration as files.</li>
            <li>The Daemon sees those files have changed and executes those changes.</li>
        </ol>
        Here's how the information is used:
        <ul>
            <li>account - Locks down the building with a new password, like cutting new keys for the locks (password) and outside access (ssh).</li>
            <li>network - Configures how the building is to be communicated with, hardline (wired) vs. celluar (wireless).</li>
            <li>
                kubernetes
                <ul>
                    <li>cluster - The name of the appartment complex this building belongs to</li>
                    <li>role - Whether this building is the head office or a rental</li>
                    <li>name - If a rental, the unit number so we know how to reference it, to folks to move it, etc.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        This is also where the Node is renamed.
        A Master node becomes (cluster)-klot-io.local and each rental becomes (name)-(cluster)-klot-io.local.
        Once renamed, they become addressible from your entire network, like getting an address from the post office.
        If you're wondering, yes, you can can have multiple clusters on the same network.
    </p>

    <p>
        Like contractors turning a block of commerical buildings into an apartment complex, the Services in the <a href="https://github.com/klot-io/pi-setup/blob/master/Install.md">Install</a> process turns our generic Raspberry Pi's into a functional, addressible Kubernetes cluster.
    </p>

    <h2>Apps</h2>

    <p>
        Functionality is typically deployed on Kubernetes using Manifests in a Declarative style.
        Declarative means we tell Kubernetes what we exepct to run where, and it changes itself to match our expectations.
        Resources are our expectations.  We put Resources in Kubernetes and it uses them as a goal.
        Manifests are just Resources in file form, usually YAML, and we usually send these files to Kubernetes to create or change Resources.
        In this case, we're using our Services like Movers, figuring what we expect, and transporting that to our apartment complex.
    </p>

    <p>
        An App in Klot I/O is a Custom (as in I created it) Resource in Kubernetes. It describes:
        <ul>
            <li>Resources to deploy to Kubernetes.</li>
            <li>Resources accesible from inside Kubernetes.</li>
            <li>Resources accesible from outside Kubernetes.</li>
            <li>Other Apps, or really type of Apps, required by this App.</li>
            <li>How to give Users access to the App.</li>
        </ul>
        For those in the know with K-town (what I've just decided to call Kubernetes), the App Custom Resource Definition is created when the Master Node is spun up.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is what happened when we went through the <a href="https://github.com/klot-io/pi-setup/blob/master/Apps.md">Apps</a> process:
        <ol>
            <li>User enters nandy-io/speech into the GUI and clicks Install.</li>
            <li>GUI sends that to the API.</li>
            <li>API uses source to download the klot-io-app.yaml from the nandy-io/speech GitHub repo.</li>
            <li>API creates an App Resource in Kubernetes from file contents sets action to 'Install'.</li>
            <li>Daemon downloads all the Manifests listed in the Speech App.</li>
            <li>Daemon downloads and install the Redis App (because Speech App says it needs it).</li>
            <li>Daemon creates a URL for us to access Speech App.</li>
        </ol>
        And with that, we tell Kubernetes how everything should be and it gets to work on that.
    </p>

    <p>
        Like movers reading manifests and executing work order, the Services in the <a href="https://github.com/klot-io/pi-setup/blob/master/Apps.md">Apps</a> process moved functionality into our Kubernetes apartment complex.
    </p>

    <h2>Culus Faciem Tuam</h2>

    <p>
        Ok, that's the real Latin phrase for "cover your butt."
        And please, don't think I'm good at Latin.
        I took a year in college, but I totally used Google translate for this bit.
        I ain't gonna front.
