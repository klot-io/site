    <h1>Long, Rambling, Dad Story</h1>

    <p>
        Ok, awhile back I took Kubernetes threw it on Raspberry Pi's and created multi-microservice 
        App that yells at my kids to get ready in the morning (in an Australian accent). 
    </p>

    <p>
        No, not kidding.  This is literally how my kids get ready in the morning now.
    </p>

    <p>
        Originally, I did this as a joke because I was bored. 
        I was thinking of controlling my window A/C unit with a Raspberry Pi, having not found a challenging enough project (RetroPie is so damn easy).
        But then I thought, that's totally overkill.  That's way too much unused processing power.
        But then I thought, I could use that extra power as a home cloud, having created little Apps for my kids to play with.
        Going further, I could probably do something with Kubernetes, making it easier to deploy changes vs. SSH'ing or even burning SD cards.
        So I set out on a crazy, probably impossible journey to put Kubernetes on Raspberry Pi's 
    </p>

    <p>
        Here's the weird thing: it worked.  
    </p>

    <p>
        Beyond that success, I realized I had created a platform.  
        When I say I installed Kuberenetes and the App runs on that, I'm not kidding.  
        I have Pods interacting with the Pi's GPIO; DaemonSets deploying to Node that I simply label that they have a Button; 
        those DaemonSets pushing events to Redis channels; Daemons reacting to those events, saying Chores are done, and on and on.
    </p>

    <p>
        What's really cool is the kids like to use this (called Nandy), creating their own chores or just changing the order, etc. 
        Since my kids and are having a blast with all this, I thought I'd share what I'd done.
